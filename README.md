### Hi, I,m Marcelo! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a technology and artificial intelligence enthusiast with experience in communication and film. With over 10 years of experience in the world of cinema, I made a career transition to the IT field in search of new creative challenges.

Currently, I am immersing myself in the studies of Prompt Engineering and Front-End Web Development, ideal areas to connect IT and creativity. Thanks to my experience as a screenwriter, writer, and film producer, I have unique skills to create prompts that provide sufficient information and context for AI to understand the client's needs and generate precise and relevant outputs.

I also possess skills in social engineering and OSINT, being responsible for these areas in elections and civil processes. I have used these skills to conduct digital investigations and produce evidence from data and information.

I have a degree in Communication from the Federal University of Santa Maria and experience in the film industry, with training at the Darcy Ribeiro Film School. I have written books, scripts for short and medium-length films, and comic book stories. Additionally, I have skills in writing institutional texts, interviews, and producing articles for blogs.

I am open to new opportunities and would love to talk to you about technology and creativity, AI, and the arts. Feel free to add me and send a message.
